# Charlotte Interaction Demo

A simple HTML/CSS/JS project for your interaction demo.

## How to use:

1. **Open the project**: Double-click `index.html` or open it in your browser
2. **Add your CodePen content**:
   - Copy HTML from CodePen → paste into `index.html` (replace the placeholder content)
   - Copy CSS from CodePen → paste into `styles.css` (replace the placeholder comment)
   - Copy JavaScript from CodePen → paste into `script.js` (replace the placeholder comment)

## File structure:
```
charlotte-html-project/
├── index.html      # Main HTML file
├── styles.css      # CSS styles
├── script.js       # JavaScript functionality
└── README.md       # This file
```

## Quick start:
1. Replace the placeholder content in each file with your CodePen code
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Your demo should work exactly like it did in CodePen!

## Tips:
- Keep external dependencies (fonts, libraries) in the HTML `<head>` section
- Make sure all file paths are correct
- Test in different browsers if needed
